# forces-archive-23

An archive of notable Sonic Forces mods I've worked on from 2018 to 2019.

Aside from (debatably) Windmill Isle, nothing in this repo is polished or release-ready, so do not make any showcase videos or any similar content about it.

# Ocean Palace

A very unfinished Sonic Heroes level port.

# Open Collision

Mod that enables collision on every single model in Sunset Heights.

At one point, there were versions of this mod for Lost Valley and Luminous Forest, but they are most likely lost.

The zip is split into multiple parts due to GitHub not accepting files that are above 100MB.

# Planet Wisp

Generated with PTKay's GensToForces converter with a small amount of tweaks.

# Windmill Isle Act 1

A Sonic Unleashed level port that I collaborated on with Robowil in late 2019.

It used to be hosted on GameBanana, but was taken down at some point.

The zip included in this repo is not the original GameBanana zip, I had to split it into multiple parts due to GitHub's file size limitations.

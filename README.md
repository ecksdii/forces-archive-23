# forces-archive-23

An archive of notable Sonic Forces mods I've made during 2018/2019.

Nothing in this repo is polished or release-ready, so do not make any showcase videos or any similar content about it.

# Planet Wisp 

Generated with PTKay's GensToForces converter with very little tweaks.

# Open Collision

Mod that enables collision on every single model in Sunset Heights.

The zip is split into multiple parts due to GitHub not accepting files that are above 100MB.

A very unfinished Sonic Heroes level port.

# Windmill Isle Act 1
